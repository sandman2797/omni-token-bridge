This is a community project by built by [Sandman](https://x.com/sandman2797) to help others bridge the $OMNI token across various EVM chains using LayerZero. 
Bridge [here](https://omni-token-bridge-eight.vercel.app/). 

### Why?

Here's the LayerZeroScan [txn](https://layerzeroscan.com/tx/0x2b579a416a9b1236723077e9078c3db254afcc1dd262d9c4dc09c7e3a21cc16c).
